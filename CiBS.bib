  abstract = {The rise of modern medicine has led to a distinction between physical illness and health based on physiological measures. Psychiatry, the study of mental disorders, contingent on the medical model, attempts to establish a science that distinguishes between normal and pathological conditions. Following the work of the medical doctor George Canguilhem, this paper provides a conceptual analysis of disorders. Along the lines of Canguilhem, I will argue that medicine and psychiatry cannot be sciences in the sense in which physics or chemistry are sciences (that is, with a claim of objectivity or being value-free), because to establish that someone is healthy or has a pathology requires a normative act \textendash{} and thus a departure from any ideals of objectivity. Health means the ability to maintain life given the existing circumstances, whereas pathology is the diminished possibility of adaptation to the environment. Because health and pathology are the irreducible result of the relationship between the organism and its environment, an individual cannot objectively be assigned a pathology or disorder.},

Many researchers use landscapes as a metaphor to illustrate the concept of stability, but so far there is no method to quantify the stability of a system's phases. We here propose a method to construct the potential landscape for multivariate psychological models. This method is based on the generalized potential function defined by Wang et~al. (2008) and Monte Carlo simulation. Based on potential landscapes we define three different types of stability for psychological phases: absolute stability, relative stability, and geometric stability. The panic disorder model by Robinaugh et~al. (2019) is used as an example, to demonstrate how the method can be used to quantify the stability of states and phases, illustrate the influence of model parameters, and guide model modifications. An R package, simlandr, was developed to provide an implementation of the method.},

In this article, we aim to bridge this gap by presenting a framework for the theoretical advancement and empirical investigation of sudden changes in clinical trajectories. We begin by introducing the mechanisms and features of three distinct types of transitions drawn from complex system research: bifurcation-induced tipping (B-tipping), noise-induced tipping (N-tipping), and rate-induced tipping (R-tipping). Additionally, we introduce distribution change (D-change), in which the system does not experience a single abrupt transition but a change in its overall state distribution. We use real-life examples to illustrate how those theoretical types of change can be connected to clinical phenomena. Finally, we show how and why the type of transition may differ for specific research questions, and why clearly defining the system of interest is required for determining the appropriate type of transition.},

Existing time-series methods often have limitations, such as assuming linear interactions or having restricted forms, leading to difficulties in capturing the complex nature of these systems. To address this issue, we introduce fitlandr, a method with implementation as an R package that integrates nonparametric estimation of the drift-diffusion function and stability landscape. The drift-diffusion function is estimated using the multivariate kernel estimator (MVKE; Bandi \& Moloche, 2018), and the stability landscape is estimated through Monte-Carlo estimation of the steady-state distribution (Cui et al., 2021; Cui, Lichtwarck-Aschoff, et al., 2023). Using a simulated emotional system, we demonstrate that fitlandr can effectively recover bistable dynamics from data, even in the presence of moderate noise, and that it primarily relies on dynamic information from the system instead of distributional information. We then apply the method to two empirical single-participant experience sampling method data sets and compared the results with the simulation data sets. Whereas both data sets show a bimodal distribution, fitlandr only revealed bistability in one of them, indicating that bimodality in ILD does not necessarily imply the existence of bistability in the underlying system. These results demonstrate the potential of fitlandr as a tool for uncovering the rich, nonlinear dynamics of psychological systems from ILD.

They have also claimed that the network theory should include non-symptom variables such as environmental factors. How are environmental factors incorporated in the network theory, and what kind of explanations of psychiatric disorders can such an ``extended'' network theory provide? The aim of this article is to critically examine what explanatory strategies the network theory that includes both symptoms and environmental factors can accommodate. We first analyze how proponents of the network theory conceptualize the relations between symptoms and between symptoms and environmental factors. Their claims suggest that the network theory could provide insight into the causal mechanisms underlying psychiatric disorders. We assess these claims in light of network analysis, Woodward's interventionist theory, and mechanistic explanation, and show that they can only be satisfied with additional assumptions and requirements. Then, we examine their claim that network characteristics may explain the dynamics of psychiatric disorders by means of a topological explanatory strategy. We argue that the network theory could accommodate topological explanations of symptom networks, but we also point out that this poses some difficulties. Finally, we suggest that a multilayer network account of psychiatric disorders might allow for the integration of symptoms and non-symptom factors related to psychiatric disorders and could accommodate both causal/mechanistic and topological explanations.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

We argue such time series likely violate the assumptions required for valid statistical inference, such as the memoryless-ness property (due to the presence of long-range temporal correlations) and ergodicity (due to non-stationarity and non-homogeneity of central moments). Moreover, we consider the common practice of interpreting outcomes of self-reports as if they were outcomes of classical physical measurements as extremely problematic and suggest to consider them as records of the temporal evolution of observables of a complex adaptive system with internal state dynamics. We propose to address some of these issues by analyzing the Change Profile instead of the observed time series, using recurrence-bases analyses, specifically, (multiplex) recurrence networks. We analyze a publicly available data set in which 4 participants rated 6 questions about their self-esteem and physical self, twice a day over a period of 512 days and introduce the concept of recurrence networks weighted by recurrence time. The edge weights represent either recurrence times or recurrence time frequencies and results show the scaling relation between vertex degree and vertex strength (the weighted variant of vertex degree), is associated to the scaling relation between frequency and spectral power based on the `raw' time series. In addition, we present a new spiral layout for recurrence networks that might be more appropriate when the detection of critical periods, regime shifts and tipping points requires insight in the temporal order in which those events occur. We conclude a complex systems approach to analyzing multivariate time series of self-reports of human experience is preferred over and above fitting statistical models like the Gaussian Graphical Model, or its derivatives.},

Recurrence-based analyses are known for their ability to detect differences in behavioral modes and order transitions in extremely noisy data. As a proof of principle, the present paper provides an example of a recurrence network based analysis strategy which can be implemented in a clinical setting in which data from an individual is continuously monitored for the purpose of making decisions about diagnosis and intervention. Specifically, it is demonstrated that measures based on the geometry of the phase space can serve as Early Warning Signals of imminent phase transitions. A publicly available multivariate time series is analyzed using so-called cumulative Recurrence Networks (cRN), which are recurrence networks with edges weighted by recurrence time and directed towards previously observed data points. The results are compared to previous analyses of the same data set, benefits, limitations and future directions of the analysis approach are discussed.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Currently, there is no general 'best' method that will perform well in most contexts. Inter-system recurrence networks (IRN) combine auto-recurrence and cross-recurrence matrices to create a graph that represents interacting networks. The method is appealing because it is based on cross-recurrence quantification analysis, a welldeveloped method for studying synchronization between 2 systems, which can be expanded in the IRN framework to include N{$>$}2 interacting networks. In this study we examine whether IRN can be used to analyze coupling dynamics between physiological variables (acceleration, blood volume pressure, electrodermal activity, heart rate and skin temperature) observed in a client in residential care with severe to profound intellectual disabilities (SPID) and their professional caregiver. Based on the cross-clustering coefficients of the IRN conclusions about the coupling direction (client or caregiver drives the interaction) can be drawn, however, deciding between bi-directional coupling or no coupling remains a challenge. Constructing the full IRN, based on the multivariate time series of 5 coupled processes, reveals the existence of potential feedback loops. Further study is needed to be able to determine dynamics of coupling between the different layers.},

They, however, fail to include a comparison with the great advances in theory-based measurement achieved in modern physics. In this commentary, I describe how measurement is formalized in classical physics and examine what would be required to formalize the physical measurement of psychological phenomena.

In the present paper, I argue that an ontological commitment to complex adaptive systems is not only possible, but highly recommended for the study of resilience in development. Such a commitment, however, also comes with a commitment to a different causal ontology and different research methods. In the first part of the paper, I discuss the extent to which current research on resilience in development conceptually adheres to the complex systems perspective. In the second part, I introduce conceptual tools that may help researchers conceptualize causality in complex systems. The third part discusses idiographic methods that could be used in a research program that embraces the interaction dominant causal ontology and idiosyncratic nature of the dynamics of complex systems. The conclusion is that a strong ontological commitment is warranted, but will require a radical departure from nomothetic science.},

This article illustrates limitations of these standard tools, and considers the benefits of adopting a complex adaptive systems approach to behaviour change research. It (1) outlines the complexity of behaviours and behaviour change interventions; (2) introduces readers to some key features of complex systems and how these relate to human behaviour change; and (3) provides suggestions for how researchers can better account for implications of complexity in analysing change mechanisms. We focus on three common features of complex systems (i.e., interconnectedness, non-ergodicity and non-linearity), and introduce Recurrence Analysis, a method for non-linear time series analysis which is able to quantify complex dynamics. The supplemental website provides exemplifying code and data for practical analysis applications. The complex adaptive systems approach can complement traditional investigations by opening up novel avenues for understanding and theorising about the dynamics of behaviour change.},

I do so by first introducing underdetermination as an explanatory framework for determining the evidential import of research findings for theories, and showing how both broader theoretical considerations and informal assumptions are key to this process. Then, I derive the aforementioned core problem from the current `theory crisis' literature and tentatively explore its possible solutions. Lastly, I show that formal modelling is neither a necessary nor sufficient solution for either contrastive or holistic underdetermination, and that its uncritical adoption might instead worsen the crisis.},

Hence, it must be possible to find general change profiles in time series data of fully personalized questionnaires. In the current study, we examined general change profiles in personalized self-ratings and related these to four measures of treatment outcome (International Symptom Rating, 21-item Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale, daily symptom severity, and self-reflective capacity). We analyzed data of 404 patients with mood and/or anxiety disorders who completed daily self-ratings on personalized questionnaires during psychotherapy. For each patient, a principal component analysis was applied to the multivariate time series in order to retrieve an univariate person-specific time series. Then, using classification and regression methods, we examined these time series for the presence of general change profiles. The change profile classification yielded the following distribution of patients: no-shift (n = 55; 14\%), gradual-change (n = 52; 13\%), one-shift (n = 233; 58\%), reversed-shift (n = 39; 10\%) and multiple-shifts (n = 25; 6\%). The multiple-shift group had better treatment outcome than the no-shift group on all outcome measures. The one-shift and gradual-change groups had better treatment outcome than the no-shift group on two and three outcome measures, respectively. Overall, this study illustrates that person-specific (idiographic) and general (nomothetic) aspects of psychopathology can be integrated in a complex systems approach to psychopathology, which may combine ``the best of both worlds.''

  abstract = {Psychopathology research is changing focus from group-based ``disease models'' to a personalized approach inspired by complex systems theories. This approach, which has already produced novel and valuable insights into the complex nature of psychopathology, often relies on repeated self-ratings of individual patients. So far, it has been unknown whether such self-ratings, the presumed observables of the individual patient as a complex system, actually display complex dynamics. We examine this basic assumption of a complex systems approach to psychopathology by testing repeated self-ratings for three markers of complexity: memory, the presence of (time-varying) short- and long-range temporal correlations; regime shifts, transitions between different dynamic regimes; and sensitive dependence on initial conditions, also known as the ``butterfly effect,'' the divergence of initially similar trajectories.},

  abstract = {There is a renewed interest for complex adaptive system approaches that can account for the inherently complex and dynamic nature of psychopathology. Yet a theory of psychopathology grounded in the principles of complex adaptive systems is lacking. Here, we present such a theory based on the notion of dynamic patterns: patterns that are formed over time. We propose that psychopathology can be understood as a dynamic pattern that emerges from self-organized interactions between interdependent biopsychosocial processes in a complex adaptive system comprising a person in their environment. Psychopathology is emergent in the sense that it refers to the person-environment system as a whole and cannot be reduced to specific system parts. Psychopathology as a dynamic pattern is also self-organized, meaning that it arises solely from the interdependencies in the system: the interactions between countless biopsychosocial variables. All possible manifestations of psychopathology will correspond to a wide variety of dynamic patterns. Yet we propose that the development of these patterns over time can be described by general principles of pattern formation in complex adaptive systems. A discussion of implications for classification, intervention, and public health concludes the article. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {Whereas sudden gains and losses (large shifts in symptom severity) in patients receiving psychotherapy appear abrupt and hence may seem unexpected, hypotheses from complex-systems theory suggest that sudden gains and losses are actually preceded by certain early-warning signals (EWSs). We tested whether EWSs in patients' daily self-ratings of the psychotherapeutic process predicted future sudden gains and losses. Data were collected from 328 patients receiving psychotherapy for mood disorders who completed daily self-ratings about their therapeutic process using the Therapy Process Questionnaire (TPQ). Sudden gains and losses were classified from the Problem Intensity scale of the TPQ. The other items of the TPQ were used to compute the EWSs. EWSs predicted an increased probability for sudden gains and losses in a 4-day predictive window. These results show that EWSs can be used for real-time prediction of sudden gains and losses in clinical practice.},

  abstract = {Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) of affect, cognition and behavior aims to provide a `window into a person's daily life'. But what should we look for through this window? In this paper, we compare a statistical perspective, grounded in probability theory, with a dynamic pattern perspective, grounded in complexity theory, on two common phenomena in EMA data: non-stationarity and outlying values. From a statistical perspective, these phenomena are considered nuisances that should be dealt with. From a dynamic pattern perspective, in contrast, non-stationarity may signal transitions from one dynamic pattern to another (e.g., a transition from a neutral to a persistent sad mood), whereas outlying values may signal recovery from perturbations (e.g., stressful life events). We evaluated the dynamic pattern view with a triangulation study of multiple single cases that took part in the Track your Mood EMA study, where participants reported on their emotions and daily events for 60 days. We found that non-stationarity was indeed related to a pattern transition, whereas outlying values were related to recovery after perturbations. These findings show that person-oriented EMA research would benefit from a dynamic pattern perspective that can identify highly meaningful and clinically relevant phenomena that are otherwise at risk of being missed. Complementing EMA time series with contextual information and qualitative data will be essential to genuinely understand these phenomena.},

As an integrated part of their treatment, more than 400 clients created a personalized case formulation in the form of a network together with their therapists (the ISM) and completed a questionnaire based on their ISM daily during their treatment. We examined the content of the ISMs with thematic analysis and found that the ISMs were highly individualized and contained a wide range of themes. When examining the daily questionnaire data, we found that although for each client their own individual change process was measured, we could still classify general change profiles (e.g., sudden or gradual change) that also related to treatment outcome. We end the article with a reflection on how personalized process monitoring can be used in treatment and to gain insights in personal change.},

  abstract = {Case formulation is at the heart of personalised care in psychotherapy. Scientific research into case formulations can provide new insights in the heterogeneity of psychopathology which are relevant for advances in personalised psychopathology research and practice. This mixed-methods study examined the content of 483 fully personalised network-based case formulations in psychotherapy in terms of uniqueness (i.e., frequencies of concepts) and commonality (i.e., the presence of common themes over the different case formulations). In a real-world clinical care setting, patients co-created network-based case formulations with their therapist as part of their routine diagnostic process. These case formulations feature concepts that are relevant to individual patients and their current situation. We assessed how often concepts were used by different patients to quantify uniqueness. We applied a bottom-up thematic analysis to identify patient-relevant themes from the concepts. The case formulations of 483 patients diagnosed with mood and/or anxiety disorders contained a total of 4908 interpretable concepts of which 4272 (87\%) were completely unique. Through thematic analysis, we identified seven overarching themes in the concepts: autonomy, connectedness, emotions, self-care, identity, self-efficacy, and bodily sensations. Case formulations were highly unique, thereby illustrating the importance of personalised diagnostics. The unique concepts could be grouped under seven overarching themes which seem to encompass basic human needs. Current advancements in personalised diagnostics and assessment should have a broader scope than symptoms alone, and could use the themes identified here as part of a topic list in the generation of (network-based) case formulations.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}This study investigates human performance in a cyclic Fitts task at three different scales of observation, either in the presence (difficult condition) or in the absence (easy condition) of a speed\textendash accuracy trade-off. At the fastest scale, the harmonicity of the back and forth movements, which reflects the dissipation of mechanical energy, was measured within the timeframe of single trials. At an intermediate scale, speed and accuracy measures were determined over a trial. The slowest scale pertains to the temporal structure of movement variability, which evolves over multiple trials. In the difficult condition, reliable correlations across each of the measures corroborated a coupling of nested scales of performance. Participants who predominantly emphasized the speed-side of the trade-off (despite the instruction to be both fast and accurate) produced more harmonic movements and clearer 1/{$<$}italic{$>$}f{$<$}/italic{$>$} scaling in the produced movement time series, but were less accurate and produced more random variability in the produced movement amplitudes (vice versa for more accurate participants). This implied that speed\textendash accuracy trade-off was accompanied by a trade-off between temporal and spatial streams of 1/{$<$}italic{$>$}f{$<$}/italic{$>$} scaling, as confirmed by entropy measures. In the easy condition, however, no trade-offs nor couplings among scales of performance were observed. Together, these results suggest that 1/{$<$}italic{$>$}f{$<$}/italic{$>$} scaling is more than just a byproduct of cognition. These findings rather support the claim that interaction-dominant dynamics constitute a coordinative basis for goal-directed behavior.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Time series of human performances present fluctuations around a mean value. These fluctuations are typically considered as insignificant, and attributable to random noise. Over recent decades, it became clear that temporal fluctuations possess interesting properties, however, one of which the property of fractal 1/f scaling. 1/f scaling indicates that a measured process extends over a wide range of timescales, suggesting an assembly over multiple scales simultaneously. This paper reviews neurological, physiological, and cognitive studies that corroborate the claim that 1/f scaling is most clearly present in healthy, well-coordinated activities. Prominent hypotheses about the origins of 1/f scaling are confronted with these reviewed studies. It is concluded that 1/f scaling in living systems appears to reflect their genuine complex nature, rather than constituting a coincidental side-effect. The consequences of fractal dynamics extending from the small spatial and temporal scales (e.g., neurons) to the larger scales of human behavior and cognition, are vast, and impact the way in which relevant research questions may be approached. Rather than focusing on specialized isolable subsystems, using additive linear methodologies, nonlinear dynamics, more elegantly so, imply a complex systems methodology, thereby exploiting, rather than rejecting, mathematical concepts that enable describing large sets of natural phenomena.},
